# Hololens YOLOv4 Object Recognition
With this repository you can access and evaluate the camera stream of your Microsoft Hololens to recognize at what objects the user is currently looking at. 
The code is largely a combination of two repositories. For accessing the frames of the Hololens camera the code in [IntelligentEdgeHOL](https://github.com/Azure/IntelligentEdgeHOL) has been reused. TO run YOLOv4 object recognition for a single frame, the code in [tensorflow-yolov4-tflite](https://github.com/theAIGuysCode/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite) has been reused.
