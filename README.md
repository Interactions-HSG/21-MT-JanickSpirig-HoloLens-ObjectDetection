# Hololens YOLOv4 Object Recognition
With this repository you can access and evaluate the camera stream of your Microsoft Hololens to recognize at what objects the user is currently looking at. 
The code is largely a combination of two repositories.
- Access Hololens camera stream: [IntelligentEdgeHOL](https://github.com/Azure/IntelligentEdgeHOL)
- Run YOLOv4 object recognition for a single frame: [tensorflow-yolov4-tflite](https://github.com/theAIGuysCode/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite)

## Geeting Started

1. Device Portal Credentials
Configure the Hololens Device Portal as explained in [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/platform-capabilities-and-apis/using-the-windows-device-portal). Save and remember your user credentials that you defined in [this step](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/platform-capabilities-and-apis/using-the-windows-device-portal#creating-a-username-and-password).
